## Proposed agenda

* Phylopipe2/Datapipe
* Scorpio
* Microreact 
* AOB

## Previous actions

No actions

## Special items

### DAs to use CLIMB for sender_sample_id

* Await progress report from SN on his return

### Phylopipe2

* Phylopipe2 `latest` now used by all downstream processes without any issues
* Moved s3 upload to be triggered when it finishes so it now is advertised earlier to analytics

## Standing items

### Current development work

## Phylopipe

* Extensive tracing has been added to track which samples are handled by which methods. This writes to my master metadata, but does output a boolean column to consortium metadata with the `is_excluded` and `why_excluded`  - hopefully summarizing the useful info
* Still struggling with split clades in the tree - the latest trees on climb do not have extra usher samples added in, only a base fasttree (split grafted as in phylopipe1) plus those from the last couple of days, I’ve added masking of problematic sites which could be causing them, I’ve added pruning steps to get rid of sections of the tree with very long branches/too many private mutations.
* Some updates to civet outputs to make them more compatible once everyone started using them and problems were flagged

## Datapipe

* Nothing to report, seems to be doing fine.

## Pangolin/Scorpio/Constellations
Scorpio now overwrites the lineage column within pangolin if if finds a VOC/VUI after a billion github issues saying “My sample has the wrong lineage but was called correctly by scorpio” (although checks if is child lineage). This initially caused a few hiccoughs because of unexpected things in constellations definitions which I didn’t know about.

## Microreact

* The default view (https://microreact.org/project/cogconsortium/) now pulls in pre-aggregated data with just counts per lineage. This allows a much speedier loading of the page and a snappier feel to the interactivity. From this there is a link to a view of the last 3 months data including a tree
* A complete view of the data + tree is [available](https://beta.microreact.org/project/wBQA5ix4ziTZNyvn5bvkXd-uk-sars-cov-2-2019-12-242021-06-10) but may only render on beefy machines

### AOB

* No other business
